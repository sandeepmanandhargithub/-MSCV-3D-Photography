# 3D-Photography
3D photography using weak structured light
Based on Work by J.Y Bouget

In this work, we present a cheap 3D-scanning technique that uses a USB camera, a led light and a thin cylindrical object to cast shadow.
The USB camera is calibrated using a planer homography. The led light's location is obtained using shadow of a thin object with known height, placed at different locations in the plane.

The triagulation is obtained by intersection of shadow plane and the ray of light from the camera.
